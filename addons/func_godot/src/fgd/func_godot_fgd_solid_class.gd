## FGD SolidClass entity definition, used to define brush entities.
## A [MeshInstance3D] will be generated by FuncGodotMap according to this definition's Visual Build settings. If FuncGodotFGDSolidClass [member node_class] inherits [CollisionObject3D] then one or more [CollisionShape3D] nodes will be generated according to Collision Build settings.
